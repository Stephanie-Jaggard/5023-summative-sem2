## A once in a lifetime chance to change, the effect of increasing temperatures on the Silver Spotted Skipper butterfly wing size  

*This is a brief abstract-style introduction to my project*  

### Introduction ðŸ¦‹

In this data analysis, univoltine butterfly species the Silver Spotted Skipper, latin name _Hesperia comma_, is being used to determine if climate changeâ€™s increased environmental temperatures are having a significant effect on the morphology of these butterflies.  

The hypothesis is as follows: A butterflyâ€™s forewing size (mm) will get larger with higher environmental temperatures (Â°C). Other factors are included in the analysis which may have an effect on morphology.  
With a secondary hypothesis that male butterflies are more sensitive to the environmental changes than females (Fenberg et al, 2016)  

### Analysis ðŸ“Š  

For my analysis, I used a linear model to analyse the correlation for male and female butterflies of the relationship between forewing size (mm) as the response variable and the mean temperature during June (Â°C) as the predictor variable. I tested the confidence intervals and effect size of my data for my regression analysis to examine the strength and stability of the relationship between variables. I checked the assumptions for the data, noting the distribution type, homogeneity and outliers and the effect these have on my conclusion. 
I repeated this for a dataset of all male butterflies to investigate the stronger relationship. Finally, predicted values for size were created to investigate further effects of increasing and decreasing temperature effects of climate change.  

### Conclusions ðŸ§©  

In conclusion, there is a tenuous relationship between forewing length and temperature and there is a difference between the males and the combined dataset, where, calculated in analyses, males seem to be more sensitive to temperature change.
